Technical task
1. Build the following application.
2. At the first launch, the application makes a request to the server, from which the response should follow true | false.
3. If the answer is correct, a WebView with the site html5test.com (http://html5test.com/) should open.
4. Cookies, javascript, cache must work in WebView. When the screen is flipped, the Activity should not be overwritten.
5. If the answer is false - a stub in the form of a unique game should open. The genre is arbitrary. It must not be released or available in open source.
7. When you restart the application, it will always open what was opened the first time it was launched, even without a response from the server.
8. Implement a mechanism in which, without reinstalling the application, it would be possible to perform a second "first launch".
9. The application must be implemented using any convenient technology (MVVM, MVP, MVC, etc.).
